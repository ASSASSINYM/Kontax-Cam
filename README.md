# Kontax Cam
Kontax Cam is an instant camera built 100% using Swift for iOS. You can take your photos with the filters personally made and cloned from my own lightroom preset that I used for my photography. You can also apply some filters to make it look like a film photo, or customise it to look digital-film.

If you want to contribute or push some fun little features, feel free to submit a PR üòÅ

 ** IMPORTANT**
 I disabled manual pushing of the filters and effects as of [this commit](https://github.com/kxvn-lx/Kontax-Cam/commit/70e3099739d4a3c5bd85427fdd3f3c879e776c32)
 to support future collaborators having their filters available in-app. So if you wished to try out the filters - please contact me.
