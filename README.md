# Kontax Cam
[Download on the app store!](https://apps.apple.com/app/kontax-cam/id1527110773)

Kontax Cam is an instant camera built 100% using Swift for iOS. You can take your photos with the filters personally made and cloned from my own lightroom preset that I used for my photography. You can also apply some filters to make it look like a film photo, or customise it to look digital-film.

If you want to contribute or push some fun little features, feel free to contact me! üòÅ
